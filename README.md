# Insurance Policy Tracker

A Python3 Flask web-app to track & store all LIC and HDFC policy premium payments. This web-app retrieves the policy details by reading the
policy PDF documents, stores them in a SQLite database & displays the information on the UI.

It also allows to download the PDF files for future reference & delete the individual records.

If the PDF file can't be read, the web-app lets us enter the details manually.
